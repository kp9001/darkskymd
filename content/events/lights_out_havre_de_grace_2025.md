Join Lindsay Jacks, Executive Director of Lights Out Baltimore, to learn about the impacts of light pollution on birds. You will learn about the threats to birds, the work being done to monitor impacts and educate the community, as well as what you can do to reduce light pollution and help the cause. Local conservation groups will be on hand with displays showing how they are working to help the community and how you can help them.
